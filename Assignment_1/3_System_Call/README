LIST OF FILES:

main.c
	Gets the number to be factorised from the user and passes the number and an array 
	in which the factors are to be stored to the predefined system call.
	Then prints the returned array as formatted output.

factorList.c
	Gets as parameter a number and an empty array to store factors.
	Calculates the list of factors and stores them in the passed array.

makefile
	Used to compile or remove the factorlist object file.

HOW TO COMPILE:
	$ make factorlist

HOW TO EXECUTE:
    $ ./factorlist

ADDING SYSTEM CALL TO LINUX KERNEL:
	1. Get the Linux kernel source corresponding to the installed version

			apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)

	2. Extract the tar.gz file downloaded
 
 			tar -xvzf linux_4.4.0.orig.tar.gz

	3. Change your current directory to the extracted directory

			cd linux-4.4.0

	4. Create a directory factorList in the kernel source directory:-

	   	    mkdir factorList

    5. Change into this directory

      	    cd factorList

    6. Create a “Makefile” in the factorList folder and add the given line  to it.

			gedit Makefile

	7. add the following line to it

			obj-y := factorList.o

	8. change back into the linux-4.4.0 folder and open Makefile

			gedit Makefile

	9. Find the line which says :-   “core-y += kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ ”
	   change this to   “core-y += kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ factorList/”

	10. Go to  arch/x86/entry/syscalls

			gedit syscall_64.tbl

	11. Add the following line in the end 

			326    common    factorList    sys_factorList

	12. Go to include/linux and open syscalls.h

			gedit syscalls.h

	13. Add this line to the end of the file just before the #endif.

			asmlinkage long sys_factorList(int number, int *factorArray);

	14. If no changes are to be made to the kernel, do

   	    	make oldconfig

	15. To compile the main Kernel. Use -j in a multicore system
   	    to run the jobs in parallel
 
 	    	make -j

	16. To compile the kernel modules:

    		make modules -j

	17. To install the kernel modules:

   			make modules_install -j

	18. To install the New Kernel

			make install -j
