LIST OF FILES:

main.c
   Passes the Number of strings to the readInput() function 
   and gets the resultant reverse concatenated character array.

readInput.c
	Gets as parameter the Number of strings.
	Gets the given number of strings using read() system call.
	Returns a reverse concatenated char array.

readInput.h
	Contains declaration of function readInput()

Makefile
    Contains make and clean commands to create or delete the readInput object file.

HOW TO COMPILE:
	$ make readInput

HOW TO EXECUTE:
    $ ./readInput

PROGRAM STRUCTURE:
	1. Execute the main function

	2. Read the number of lines from user

	3.Read the maximum string size from from user

	4. Allocate a 1D array called result dynamically.

	3. Pass number of lines Number_of_strings, size and the allocated char array as parameter to readInput function and get the result.

	4. In the readInput function, Initialize arrays buffer,final and result with '\0'

	5. Read each Line into the 2D array called final and remove '/n' 
       read along with the string and replacing with space

    6. Do a pass on each string and Get the index at which each string ends
       and use that index to reverse it. 

    7. Copy the result array to a dynamic array to return it to the calling function

    8. In the main function, get the returned array and print it.

    9. Free the dynamic array.
